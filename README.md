### 🚀 Project Title: **Interactive Sales Performance Dashboard with Dash and Plotly**

### 📍 Project Description:

I built a fully interactive **Sales Performance Dashboard** using **Dash**, **Plotly**, and **Pandas**. This dashboard dynamically displays sales, profit, and quantity data across products, regions, and time intervals.

### 🔧 Features:

* 📅 **Date Range Filter**
* 🌍 **Region-wise Sales Filtering**
* 📦 **Product-based Analysis**
* 📈 **Time Aggregation** (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly)
* 📊 **KPI Metrics**: Total Sales, Profit, Average Sale, Transactions
* 📉 **Trend Analysis** via Line, Bar, Pie, and Box Plots
* 📋 **Detailed Data Table View**

### 📁 Tools & Libraries Used:

* `Dash` – For creating interactive web apps
* `Plotly` – For data visualizations
* `Pandas` – For data manipulation
* `Colab` – Development platform

---

### 📌 How It Works:

1. Sample synthetic data is generated for a full year (2023).
2. Dashboard features filters, KPIs, charts, and a table.
3. Responsive visual updates on filter change using **Dash callbacks**.
